# Description
This is my Hello World assignment. This assignment is for CS 246 Software Design and Development class at BYU-I.

#Development Environment Setup
My IDE is Visual Studio for Mac. I found documentation to [connect VS for Mac to GitHub.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/set-up-git-repository?view=vsmac-2019), and I just followed the tutorial.

# Build, Execute, and Use your program

I used Visual Studio to build and Execute. I had to make sure to configure the build settings to save changes and to show errors and warnings. Blow is the build settings configuration is used.

Once the software is built, executed "Hello World!" will be displayed in the console.
